# Eat the Burger!
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users select burgers or sides from a menu that they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's or side's name, the app will display the burger or side on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger or side in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger or side will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger or side in a database, whether devoured or not.
